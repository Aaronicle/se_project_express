# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. In this I set up the api that communicates with the database which will hold the information put into inputs on the front end of the WTW web application. To accomplish this I had to learn and implement express, mongoose, validator, routes, controllers, eslint and other back-end tools. To test the connection to the database I used postman and mongoDB compass.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
